# Package Management Systems

Package management systems are one of the key and imminent components in enabling automation of work-flows.  They enable the workforce (team members) to pull in the desired version of a custom or user component and integrete them into their projects.

Package management systems eases and provides flexibility to build and automation engineers to configure a system w.r.t. the selected version of a module or component.  These workflows could address packaging systems for components ranging from a small library or an application to a large project involving multiple teams, such as operating systems.

There exists many package management systems avaialble across the internet.  Even every operating system team has a chosen default repository system that it relies on for finding and resolving all necessary dependencies.

In order to make these packages available for developers or end-users first the libraries are needed to be packaged and uploaded to a server from where these packages could be fetched by any other application that wants to use it.  Now, since the application can be run on any operating system and any platform, the packages needs to have all required sources and binaries required to make the applications work cross-platforms.

This current repository shall hold works to creating, uploading, maintaining packages and might contain few demos too illustrating their usage within applications.
